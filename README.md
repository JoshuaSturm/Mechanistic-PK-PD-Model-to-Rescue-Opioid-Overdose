Codes upload in progress

# Requirements
The deep learning models were implemented in python 3.6 using TensorFlow version 1.9

Figures were generated using R version 4.2.1 and ggplot2 version 3.4.0

# Training 

Model training simulations found in [Training](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/tree/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/training)

# Prediction 

Prediction simulations found in [Prediction] (https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/tree/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/prediction)

Results (Figure 3 and 4 from the Manuscript) can be found in [prediction/Results](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/tree/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/prediction/Results).

Training Data and model predictions are available upon request
