## Model Predictions and Results

[Figure 3]() Results were generated using the comparison of training error for the black box and mechanistic models as seen in [Figure_Generation.R]()

The mechanistic model outperformed the black model on both a per epoch and time course basis. 

Predictions were run using the final training results for the mechanistic and black box AI models using [mechanistic](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/blob/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/prediction/simpleblock_mirrormodel_prediction.py) and [black box](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/blob/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/prediction/mymodel_prediction.py) respectively. 

These were then compared against the PLSR results [Figure 4 Generation](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/blob/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/prediction/4subgraph_All_bs2.py) as seen in [Results_Figure 4](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/blob/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/Results/Figure_4.pdf)
