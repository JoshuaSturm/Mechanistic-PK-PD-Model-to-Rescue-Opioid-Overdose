# Model Training 

Both the [mechanistic model](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/blob/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/training/simpleblock_mirrormodel_training.py) and the [black box model](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/blob/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/training/mymodel_training.py) as well as the [PLSR model](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/blob/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/training/PLSR.training.py) were trained on the same carfentanil mechanistic model simulations.

Training results for mechanistic model are found in [saved_model](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/tree/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/training/saved_model)

Training results for the black box model are found in [savedoriginal_model3](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opioid-Overdose/tree/Breaking-the-Black-Box-ML/training/savedoriginal_model3)
